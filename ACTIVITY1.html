    <H3>FRONT END:</H3>
    <P>Front-end development in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) focuses on creating the visual structure and layout of a website or web application. HTML serves as the foundation, using various tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It plays a crucial role in organizing content semantically, which improves accessibility and search engine optimization. By working in tandem with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, HTML enables developers to build responsive and user-friendly interfaces that enhance the overall web experience.</P>

    <h3>BACK END:</h3>
    <P>Back-end development refers to the server-side of a web application, where the logic, database interactions, and server configuration take place. It involves using programming languages like Python, Java, Ruby, or PHP to create APIs and manage data flow between the server and the client. The back end handles requests from the front end, processes them, and sends the appropriate responses. It also includes database management, where data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated using systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. Overall, back-end development is crucial for ensuring that web applications function smoothly, securely, and efficiently.</P>
    <H3>CHEMICAL EQUATION:</H3>
    2H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O
    <br>
    CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>
    <h3>ALGEBRA EQUATION:</h3>
    (a - b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>
    <br>
    (a + b)<sup>3</sup> = a<sup>3</sup> + b<sup>3</sup> + 3a<sup>2</sup>b + 3ab<sup>2</sup>
